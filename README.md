## 📖 Problem Statement

Building a digital platform to connect surplus food sources with NGOS for real-time redistribution and waste reduction

This problem results in:
- Increased food waste  
- Poor coordination between donors and NGOs  
- Limited access to food for needy people  
- Environmental damage  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

FoodLink is a web-based digital platform that connects surplus food providers with NGOs and volunteers in real time.

The platform allows donors to list available food with details such as quantity, type, expiry time, and location. NGOs can view nearby donations, accept requests, and arrange pickups. The system ensures fast and transparent redistribution of surplus food to people in need.

Key functionalities include:
- Real-time food listings  
- Location-based matching   
- Notifications for donors and NGOs  
- Admin monitoring panel

## 🚀 Innovation & Creativity

Our solution introduces a centralized, real-time coordination system for food redistribution using modern web technologies. Unlike traditional donation methods that rely on manual communication, FoodLink automates the entire process.

Innovative aspects include:
- Smart matching based on location and urgency  
- Digital verification of donors and NGOs  
- analytics dashboard  
- Scalable architecture for future expansion
